**Turning co-housing into a path toward home ownership**

---

## 🚨 The Problem

In Victoria, housing affordability has created a **Locked-Out Ladder** for young adults:

- The income needed to qualify for a mortgage is now ~**$180,000**
- Average **2-bedroom rent is ~$2,120/month**
- High rent makes saving for a down payment painfully slow

Many young professionals know that co-housing can help — but finding the **right roommate** is risky, inefficient, and stressful. As a result, people stay stuck renting longer than necessary.

## 💡 Our Solution

**Roost** is a roommate-matching platform that reframes co-housing as a **financial strategy**, not just a social one.

Solution to the problem:
- Shows real, local cost breakdowns gathered from the Craiglist API for house/rent and the CMHC 2025 Rental Market Report for Victoria
- Quantifies monthly savings in a detailed way (ex: shows how much you would save monthly with this roommate accounting for generally hidden costs such as commuting and utilities)
- Demonstrates how co-housing accelerates progress toward ownership
